Title: "Socrates and the Pirate: Know Thyself"
6-panel comic script

Panel 1
(Wide shot of a busy dock. Socrates and the pirate walk together, the pirate holding a treasure map, grinning.)
Pirate: Gold and plunder, Socrates—that’s the only real treasure!
Socrates: Has it given you what you seek?

Panel 2
(The pirate looks at his hook hand, frowning.)
Pirate: I’ve had riches, sure. But me crew’s only loyal as long as the gold flows. No real bond.
Socrates: Because they follow greed, not you. What do you really want?

Panel 3
(Flashback: The pirate is alone in his quarters, surrounded by gold, but looking distant. His crew is behind him, their eyes filled with suspicion.)
Pirate (voiceover): I could count on 'em... but only when their greed was met. Never felt truly valued.

Panel 4
(Socrates gestures toward a group of sailors laughing together, sharing drinks.)
Socrates: True treasure is found in deep friendships—people who see your worth, not your gold.
Pirate: I’ve never had that. Always fought for plunder, never for people.

Panel 5
(The pirate stares out at the ocean, thinking deeply.)
Pirate: I’ve sailed every sea, but what do I have? No one to share it with. Nothing that lasts.
Socrates: Purpose, friendship, creating value for others—that’s a treasure you can’t lose.

Panel 6
(The pirate stands tall, looking determined as the sun sets behind him.)
Pirate: Aye… I already got to know the seven seas. I guess it’s time to get to know myself.
Socrates: Fair winds, captain. You’ve set a wiser course.
